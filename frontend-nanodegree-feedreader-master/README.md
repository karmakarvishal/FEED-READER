Testing using Jasmine
A Udacity FEND project

This project demonstrates browser based testing using Jasmine.

Steps to run
Open index.html in the browser of your choice. It may take some time to completely load as additional network requests are made. Once loaded, test results should be displayed at the bottom of the page.
